# Waste Segregation Level Detection
###  In this project we establishe communication between two dustbins i.e.. Master and Slave, we can segregate waste and monitor the levels of dustbin to avoid flooding of dustbins. Here Master represents Dry waste collecting dustbin whereas Slave represents Wet waste collecting dustbin.
